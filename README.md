# Geostatsitics_final_project

# Instructions:

Final project:
The capstone of the course will be a final project. Students will apply concepts from the course to a real
dataset of his/her choice. Everyone has the option of working individually or in groups of up to three people. The final project should be written up in the style of a short scientific paper (e.g., up to 5 pages single-spaced, not including references for those working alone and up to 10 pages for a group project). All final reports are due by the final exam time slot. The registrar has scheduled our final exam time for Thursday, May 13 from 9am – 12pm. Final presentations will be during this time, and final reports will be due by 9am on May 13th.
